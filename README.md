# Algorithm Visualizer

## Overview
This project is an interactive algorithm visualizer that helps users understand various algorithms through visual representation. Users can see how algorithms work step-by-step, making it easier to grasp complex concepts.

## Live Demo
You can view the live demo of the project at [Algorithm Visualizer](https://algorithm-visualizer-blush-nine.vercel.app/).

## Features
- Visualize sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.
- Understand searching algorithms such as Binary Search.
- Interactive controls to step through algorithms.
- Responsive design for various devices.

## Technologies Used
- React for building the user interface.
- Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Vite for fast development and build.
